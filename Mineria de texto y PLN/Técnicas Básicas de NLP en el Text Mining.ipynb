    "### Lematización y stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "Las lemas son las formas canónicas del léxico de un idioma. Por ejemplo, en el caso del español, los verbos presentan una flexión verbal, conocida como comúnmente como conjugación, utilizada para adaptar el verbo a diferentes situaciones de contexto (número, género y tiempo verbal) y presentando distinta forma escrita. En algunas ocasiones, es útil utilizar el lema de los verbos y otras palabras para reducir la dimensionalidad en los modelos predictivos. Este proceso es conocido como lematización. Cuando se lematiza se obtiene palabras reales ya que se utilizan diccionarios jerárquicos para obtener el lema. Este diccioanrio jerárquico es conocido como WordNet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Un caso específico y simple de la lematización es el stemming, que consiste en utilizar reglas sintácticas para quitar la finalización de las palabras y reducirlas así una forma común llamada stem. Hay muchos stemmers populares como el de Porter o el de Snowball. Es importante mencionar que no siempre que se hace stemming de una palara esta es una palabra real, si no una palabra sin su última(s) letras."
